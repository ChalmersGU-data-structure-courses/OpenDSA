# Pseudocode source code

Here are Pseudocode files with all code from the book Data Structures and Algorithms. They are not possible to compile or run in any known interpreter.

All files starting called `DemoXXX.txt` are demonstrations, the other files are implementations of some data structure or algorithm that are treated by the course book.
