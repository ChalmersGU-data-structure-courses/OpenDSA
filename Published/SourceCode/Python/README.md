# Python source code

Here are Python files with all code from the book Data Structures and Algorithms. They contain some testing code, so you should be able to simply run a file and get some kind of output.

All files starting called `DemoXXX.py` are demonstrations, the other files are implementations of some data structure or algorithm that are treated by the course book.
