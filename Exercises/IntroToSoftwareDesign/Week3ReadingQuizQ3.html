            True or False: A posttest loop has its controlling condition checked before its body is executed for the first time.
          </p>

          <div class="solution">False; a pretest loop has its controlling condition checked before its body is executed for the first time.</div>
          <ul class="choices" >

            <li>False; a prior-test loop has its controlling condition checked before its body is executed for the first time.</li>
            <li>True.</li>
            <li>False; a posttest loop never has its controlling condition checked. That's why they're so useless.</li>
