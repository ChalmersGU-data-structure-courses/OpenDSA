            "sc1": "Here is the graphical depiction of what the start of a blockchain (the genesis block) would look like.The first hash is all zeroes.",
            "sc2": "The idea of the blockchain is that every block uses the hash of the preceding block in addition to different values for its own hash. Each block has its own previous hash, data message, nonce, and resulting hash.",
            "sc3": "The nonce is the foundation of block mining. Given a publicly known previous hash and data message, a nonce can be mined so that the resulting hash begins with some predetermined number of zeroes. Since brute-force calculations are the only method of mining, this provides for an equal opportunity to produce a block.",
            "sc4": "Here we have mined the nonce and produced a hash derived from the previous hash, data message, and nonce such that the hash begins with four zeroes.",
            "sc5": "The process then repeats as new data needs to be recorded and is publicly released.",
            "sc6": "Here we can see the effects of manipulating past values in the blockchain. The hash pointers don't match from then on! Since others are continually producing blocks for the main blockchain, to produce a new branch that agrees with the manipulation and grows in larger size than the main blockchain is impossible.",
