        "sc2": "Suppose that node 1 proposes a block to be added. Note that this proposed block is reflected on the chain.",
        "sc3": "However, node 4 also proposes a block at the same time.",
        "sc4": "Due to the timing, a fork appears in the blockchain. This equates to an orphaned block because the first block propagated is determined to be the head of the main chain.",
        "sc5": "Since the block that was propagated first was the green node, offered blocks will tend to build upon the green. The new green block is reflected across the network as the new head.",
        "sc6": "However, users may offer blocks specifically to the orphan! This is in an attempt to create a longer fork than the main chain. This effectively allows a fork to take main chain status.",
        "sc7": "As the network grows off these branches, one branch continues to grow longer than the other.",
        "sc8": "Since node 4's branch becomes longer, its sub-blockchain continues to be apart of the actual chain and node 1's branch is discarded."
