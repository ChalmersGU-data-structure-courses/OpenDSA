        "sc1": "Consider a blockchain network where we have four nodes, 1-4. The network is a peer-to-peer network where all nodes have their own versions of the current blockchain. They then propose and propagate blocks to adjacent nodes that then accept a new head or resolve a conflict caused by the decentralization of the network.",
        "sc2": "Suppose that green node 1 proposes green block A to be added to the chain. This is propagated throughout the network starting with adjacent nodes.",
        "sc3": "However, red node 4 also proposes red block B soon after.",
        "sc4": "Due to the timing, a theoretical fork appears in the blockchain. Some nodes have accepted green block A as the head of the blockchain while others will have accepted red block B",
        "sc5": "Since the green block is the head, offered blocks like the newly offered blue block will tend to build upon the green branch.",
        "sc6": "However, users may offer blocks specifically to an orphan! This is in an attempt to create a longer fork than the main chain and allows a fork to take main chain status. In this case, the red node would benefit from continuing its own block. However, the orange node, like any normal actor, proposes a block to the main chain.",
        "sc7": "Similar to the orange node, the non-red nodes have the best chance to benefit if they append to the main blockchain. This effectively pits a fork against the rest of the network and deincentivizes proposals on old blocks and forks that aren't the current main chain.",
        "sc8": "Since the green node's branch becomes longer, its sub-blockchain continues to be apart of the actual chain and the red branch is discarded."
