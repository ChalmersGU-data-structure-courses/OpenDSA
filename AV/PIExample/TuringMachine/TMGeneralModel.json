The control unit of the machine is defined by a set of abstract $states$. At any given instant, the machine is said to be \"in\" one of the states, and has a set of actions that can be performed when in that state. From the current state, the machine will read the symbol on the current square, and will then do the following (depending on the value of the symbol that it sees): <br> 1. Overwrite that symbol with a new symbol, <br> 2. Move the tape head either left (L), right (R), or stay (S)",
