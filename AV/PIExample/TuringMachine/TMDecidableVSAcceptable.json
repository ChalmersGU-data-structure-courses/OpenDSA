        "description": "A Turing machine is defined as follows. It has a one-dimensional tape, divided into squares. This tape extends infinitely to the left and to the right. Each square can store one character. The machine has a single I/O head that at any instant in time is \"on\" one of the squares. The control unit of the machine is defined by a set of abstract $states$. At any given instant, the machine is said to be \"in\" one of the states, and has a set of actions that can be performed when in that state. From the current state, the machine will read the symbol on the current square, and will then do the following (depending on the value of the symbol that it sees): <br> 1. Overwrite that symbol with a new symbol, <br> 2. Move the tape head either left (L), right (R), or stay (S)",

When talking about strings, since a blank is hard to see, we will use the # character to represent a blank character. Note that including # in the alphabet is for convenience only.
