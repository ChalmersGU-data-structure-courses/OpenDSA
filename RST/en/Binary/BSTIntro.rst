Chapter Introduction: Binary Search Trees
=========================================

This chapter covers *balanced binary search trees (BSTs)*, a data
structure that uses a binary tree to implement a set or a map.
Balanced BSTs are the first data structure we see that implements the
set and map operations efficiently. In a balanced BST, insertion,
deletion and lookup all take :math:`O(\log n)` time.
