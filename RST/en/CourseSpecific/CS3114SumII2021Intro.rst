CS3114 Introduction
===================

Introduction
------------

.. slide:: Introduction

   What we are doing today:

   * Administration stuff
   * Course mechanics
   * Course introduction (OpenDSA Chapter 1)

.. slide:: Administration stuff

   * `Canvas site`_-> <https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/131273>
   * Do you have a ForceAdd issue?
   * Who is here today?

   .. _Canvas site: https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/131273

.. slide:: Course Mechanics

   * Go over `Syllabus`_
   * Course online support: Canvas, OpenDSA, Web-CAT

   .. _Syllabus: https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/131273/pages/full-syllabus

.. slide:: Canvas

   We will use `Canvas`_

   * Project specs and supporting documents
   * Link to Piazza forum
   * Post scores and grades
   * Access to OpenDSA (online textbook)

   .. _Canvas: https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/131273

.. slide:: Role in the Curriculum

   * This course till show you how the choices you make in data structure and algorithm use and design impact the software tools you write.

   * Who is the class intended for?
     * Undergrad CS Majors, Minors and other computing intensive majors
     * Graduate students who may not have had a formal data structures and algorithms course as undergrads.

.. slide:: Being Successful in the Course

   * To do well, you must be able to handle both
      * Programming (we focus on projects with dynamic memory allocation and
        file processing, and they have significant design challenges)
      * Content, theory and analysis

   * The projects test programming proficiencies
   * OpenDSA exercises test knowledge of how algorithms work
   * Exams test understanding of the theory (analysis)

.. note::

   Most graduates from our department will tell you that this is one
   of the two hardest courses, and also one of the two most important
   for job preparation. So it's both high effort and high value.


.. slide:: OpenDSA

  * Access OpenDSA through Canvas->`Modules`_
  * This is the textbook.
  * Lots of visualizations, exercises
  * Mastery-based approach
  * Homework due periodically through the semester


  .. _Modules: https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/131273/modules

.. slide:: Web-CAT

  * Auto-grading: Correctness, style
  * Support for `junit`_ testing
  * Get the updated plugin (see Module section 3)
  * Project submission

  .. _junit: https://junit.org/junit4/

.. slide:: Project & Milestones

   * 3 projects, (project 1 is 1 week, projects 2 & 3 have 2 weeks)
   * Milestones designed to encourage incremental development
   * In previous semesters, milestones had the effect of boosting the final
     grade of the middle third of the class by about a full letter grade.
   * Project 1 is too short for milestones

.. slide:: Homework

   * Log into Web-CAT: https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu
   * Look at Piazza site, make sure you are enrolled there (if not, email me)
   * Look at Project 1 spec: more on that in a minute

.. slide:: Before you log out today

   * Talk to me if there is a ForceAdd issue
