Converting Objects to Table Indices
====================================

Hash codes are not table indices
----------------------------------

Now, we want to be able to calculate a table index for any kind of object.
How can we do this?
Most languages (including Java and Python), delegate this to the different classes themselves,
so that strings can decide how to hash strings, and x-ray images can decide how to hash x-ray images.
This is done by requiring a class to implement a hash method
(called ``hashCode()`` in Java, and ``__hash__()`` in Python).

   :tag: PersonHash

Now, the problem is that these classes have no idea how large the internal hash table should be,
i.e., which interval :math:`0\ldots M-1` they should return.
The solution is to divide the hash function in two:

- one that returns an integer: :math:`0\leq h < 2^{32}`

- and another that transforms (*compresses*) the hash code :math:`h`
  to an index :math:`0\leq i< M`

The first function is provided by the object class itself, and the second is
calculated by the hash table.


Compressing the hash code
-----------------------------

To compress a hash code :math:`h\geq 0` into a table indes :math:`i`,
we can take :math:`h` modulo the array size :math:`M`:
:math:`i = h \; \% \; M`.
This is called *modular hashing* and is the most common compression method.


Negative hash codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, in Java and Python, integers are signed, so the method ``hashCode()`` might return a negative integer.
If we take this modulo :math:`M`, we might get a negative result. A negative index is not suitable as a table index,
so first we have to make the hash code positive.

One way to do this is to mask off the sign bit.
Java integers are :math:`-2^{31}\leq h<2^{31}`, so we can use ``h & 0x7fffffff``.
(Python uses arbitrary size hash values, but it works fine to truncate them to 31 bits as we have done here).

   :tag: HashIndex


The hash code never changes
---------------------------------------

The generic hash codes should never change, because hashing must be predictable.
Therefore we don't have to recalculate the hash code when we resize the internal table,
it is only the table indices that have to be updated.

One implication of this is that it's only meaningful to calculate hash codes for
*immutable objects*, i.e., objects that don't change (after they are initialised).
(That's why Python allows tuples as dictionary keys, but not lists).

Python uses this fact to optimise their built-in hash tables by storing the hash codes together with the keys and values.
This increases the size of the table slightly, but on the other hand it ensures that hash codes are not calculated more than once.

In Java, the optimisation is delegated to the object classes themselves.
E.g., a Java string only calculates its hash code once and then stores it in an instance variable for immediate lookup.
