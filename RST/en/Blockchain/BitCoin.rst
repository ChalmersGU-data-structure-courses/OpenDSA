Stuff about Bitcoin goes here.

Bitcoin Wallet
--------------

One practical aspect of using Bitcoin is that, if you own bitcoins,
you need to get access to them (to conduct transactions on them).
This is a matter of supplying your credentials when you seek
to publish your transaction.
Essentially, you do this by supplying a form of public key.
The mechanics for doing this go through something called your Bitcoin
Wallet.
Among other things, the Bitcoin Wallet holds your private key.

If you lose either the Wallet file, or you password/key that gives you
access to the Wallet,
then there is no recourse.
There is no central manager of the blockchain, and so no other entity
that can grant you access.
This is one of the repercussions of Bitcoin being a distributed
currency.
If you lose the key, there is no way to recover it.

See https://www.npr.org/2020/12/30/951460511/bitcoin-losers-classic
for an interesting story of people who have lost their
bitcoins when they lost track of or lost access to their Bitcoin
Wallet.
It is estimated that some signficant fraction of all the Bitcoins that
can ever be mined have been permanently lost in this way.
