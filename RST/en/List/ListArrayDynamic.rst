Dynamic Array-Based Lists
===============================

The problem with a static array-based list is that it has a limited capacity.
If we try to add new elements when the internal array is full,
the method will throw an exception.

Resizing the internal array
------------------------------

How can we modify our class to allow for any number of elements?
One solution is to create a larger internal array whenever the capacity is exceeded,
and copy over all elements to the new one.

.. codeinclude:: ChalmersGU/DynamicArrayList
   :tag: DynamicArrayListResize

So, how large should the new internal array be?
As discussed in the module about
:ref:`string building <StringReading>`,
it's not a good idea to increase the size by a constant.
Instead we should **grow the array by a factor**, i.e. multiply not add!
For simplicity, let's double the size of the internal array when we need to resize,
which means that we add the following if-clause to the ``add`` method:

::

        if arraySize >= size of internalArray
            resizeArray(2 * size of internalArray)


So the ``add`` method will look like follows.

.. codeinclude:: ChalmersGU/DynamicArrayList
   :tag: DynamicArrayListAdd

Dynamic Array-based List: Full code
------------------------------------------------

Finally, here is the full source code for the class ``DynamicArrayList``.
Note that now the constructor doesn't take any capacity argument,
since the internal array will automatically grow when needed.

.. codeinclude:: ChalmersGU/DynamicArrayList
   :tag: DynamicArrayList
