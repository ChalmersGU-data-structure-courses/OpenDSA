  <p>Here is the course book for the course in data structures and algorithms,
    given at Chalmers University and University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

    <li><strong>Main book</strong>: <a href="Published/ChalmersGU-DSABook/html/index.html">Data Structures and Algorithms</a></li>
    <li><strong>Source code</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ChalmersGU-data-structure-courses/OpenDSA/tree/main/Published/SourceCode">Source code used in the book</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also have a smaller book containing some repetition of background knowledge:
