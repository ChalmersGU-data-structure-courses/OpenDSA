# Java source code #

Here are Java files with all code from the online book "Data Structures and Algorithms". Many of them contain some testing code, so you should be able to simply compile and run a file and get some kind of output.

They are divided into some directories:
- API: Here are interfaces and implementations of the different data structures that we present in the book.
- Sorting: Here are implementations from chapter 2, "Searching and Sorting". 
- Other: Here are other code snippets that are used throughout the book.

Some of the code snippets in `Other` make use of the API implementations. To compile them you either have to create a package, or just put them in the same folder before compiling.
